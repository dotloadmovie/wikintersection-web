This is a web client application which adds a more useful UI to the http://www.github.com/dotloadmovie/wikintersection application. It exposes a JSON API for the application using the Echo web framework and a small React SPA using Create React App to deliver to the user.

## Installation

Windows, OS X & Linux - API and wrappers

```sh
go get 
go build main.go -o wikintersection.go
./wikintersection
```

Windows, OS X and Linux - Front-end

```sh
cd ui/wikintersect
npm install
npm start
```

## Usage example

CRA will start the front-end on a local IP address. Navigate here and then add some queries. Absolutely no guarantees of rightness are given here

Feel free to fork and play around. This is really a learning application for me though so is subject to change on a whim. Could be a WASM version coming soon; who knows?
